Check autoform not showing with async blaze #if #unless #each

This is a small sample meteor project which allows us to review & fix an issue with autoform not displaying forms with a WIP PR (https://github.com/meteor/blaze/pull/424) to support async data in Blaze `#if`, `#unless` and `#each` template operators.
